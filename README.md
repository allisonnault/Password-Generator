# Password-Generator
Challenge 03

## Description

This is an application that enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria that they've selected. 

I learned how to use Javascript to collect input from the user, and return back a password based on what was selected. 
 

## Usage

User must input the desired length of thier password. It must be between 8 and 128 characters long.  

User then selects which character types they would like their password to include. They can choose from uppercase, lowercase, numeric and special characters. At least one character type must be selected. 

Then applicationi will generate a password meeting the selected criteria and display it on the page.
